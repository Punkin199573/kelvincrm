3. Never commit this file to version control

## Database Setup

### 1. Supabase Setup
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the migration files in order:
   \`\`\`sql
   -- Run these in your Supabase SQL editor

   supabase/migrations/002_setup_admin.sql
   supabase/migrations/003_session_tables.sql

   supabase/migrations/005_setup_admin_user.sql
   \`\`\`

### 2. Admin User Setup
The admin user will be automatically configured when someone signs up with the email: `cloudyzaddy@gmail.com`

**Admin Credentials:**
