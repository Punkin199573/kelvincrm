   - Password: `KelvinAdmin2024!`
3. Verify the email address
4. Admin status will be automatically assigned via database trigger

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in your `.env.local`:

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Admin Access Issues
If admin status isn't automatically assigned:
1. Check the database trigger is working
2. Manually update the profile:
\`\`\`sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET is_admin = true 
WHERE email = 'cloudyzaddy@gmail.com';
\`\`\`

### RLS Policy Issues
If you encounter permission errors:
1. Ensure all migrations have been applied
2. Check that the user is properly authenticated
3. Verify admin policies are in place

### Upload Issues
If image uploads fail:
1. Verify UploadThing environment variables
2. Check file size limits
3. Ensure proper CORS configuration

## üì± Mobile Admin Access
The admin panel is fully responsive and works on mobile devices. All admin functions are accessible through the mobile interface.

## üöÄ Production Deployment
1. Set all environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Run database migrations
3. Configure Stripe webhooks with production URL
4. Test all admin functions before going live

## üìû Support
If you encounter any issues during setup, check the console logs and database for error messages. Most issues are related to missing environment variables or incomplete migrations.
