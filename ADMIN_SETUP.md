## üîß Troubleshooting

2. Manually update the profile:
\`\`\`sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET is_admin = true 
WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
\`\`\`

### RLS Policy Issues
If you encounter permission errors:
1. Ensure all migrations have been applied
2. Check that the user is properly authenticated
3. Verify admin policies are in place

### Upload Issues
If image uploads fail:
1. Verify UploadThing environment variables
2. Check file size limits
3. Ensure proper CORS configuration

## üì± Mobile Admin Access
The admin panel is fully responsive and works on mobile devices. All admin functions are accessible through the mobile interface.

## üöÄ Production Deployment
1. Set all environment variables in your hosting platform
2. Run database migrations
3. Configure Stripe webhooks with production URL
4. Test all admin functions before going live

## üìû Support
If you encounter any issues during setup, check the console logs and database for error messages. Most issues are related to missing environment variables or incomplete migrations.

## Prerequisites

-   A deployed instance of the Kelvin Creekman Fan Club website.
-   Access to the Supabase project associated with the website.

## Steps

1.  **Access the Supabase Console:**

    -   Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
    -   Navigate to the "SQL Editor" from the left sidebar.

2.  **Create an Admin User:**

    -   Run the following SQL query to create an admin user. Replace `'admin@example.com'` and `'adminpassword'` with the desired email and password for the admin user.

    \`\`\`sql
    INSERT INTO auth.users (email, raw_app_meta_data)
    VALUES ('admin@example.com', '{"is_admin": true}');

    -- Hash the password using pgcrypto
    UPDATE auth.users
    SET encrypted_password = crypt('adminpassword', gen_salt('bf'))
    WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
    \`\`\`

3.  **Update the `profiles` Table:**

    -   Run the following SQL query to update the `profiles` table and set the `is_admin` field to `true` for the newly created user.

    \`\`\`sql
    INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, full_name, is_admin, created_at, updated_at)
    VALUES (
        (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@example.com'),
        'admin@example.com',
        'Admin User',
        TRUE,
        NOW(),
        NOW()
    );
    \`\`\`

4.  **Verify Admin Access:**

    -   Sign in to the website using the admin user's email and password.
    -   Navigate to the `/admin` route. You should now have access to the admin dashboard.

## Notes

-   Ensure that the `pgcrypto` extension is enabled in your Supabase project. You can enable it by running `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;` in the SQL Editor.
-   Remember to replace the placeholder email and password with secure credentials.
-   This setup assumes that you have the necessary RLS policies in place to protect the admin routes.
